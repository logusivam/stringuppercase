# String Uppercase in C++

This project demonstrates a simple C++ program that converts a given string to uppercase. It includes a function to convert the string and a main function to test the conversion functionality.

## Features

- **String Uppercase Conversion**: A function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all characters converted to uppercase.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Uses basic C++ constructs for efficient string manipulation.

## Installation

To use this project, simply download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logusivam/stringuppercase.git

Alternatively, you can directly copy the `stringuppercase.cpp` file into your project directory.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang).

2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
```
g++ stringuppercase.cpp -o stringuppercase
```

3. Run the compiled executable:
```
./stringuppercase
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a string and see the uppercase output.
